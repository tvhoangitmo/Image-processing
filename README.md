# Image Processing with NumPy and Matplotlib

## Description
This project uses a Jupyter Notebook to perform basic image processing tasks. I utilize the NumPy library to access and manipulate image data, and Matplotlib to display images.

## Requirements
Before running the notebook, ensure you have installed the necessary packages. You can install them using a `requirements.txt` file or directly from the notebook.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tvhoangitmo/Image-processing
   cd Image-precessing
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open the `main.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells.

## Usage
This notebook includes the following steps:
- Displaying an RGB image using Matplotlib.
- Accessing image data with NumPy arrays to perform image processing operations.
